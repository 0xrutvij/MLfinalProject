# MLfinalProject


**Files in this Project:**
  
    dataProc - This is a preliminary analysis of the data, including histograms and simple curve fitting.
    perceptron - Creates a perceptron model using batch gradient descent with RMSprop.
    binTreeMain - An emsemble of binary decision trees implementing bagging and Adaboost.
    SingleLayerNN - A simple neural network with options of sigmoid, tanh, and ReLu for the activation function and that uses RMSProp
